# Bank Marketing

## Problem Statement

The dataset is based on the direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. These marketing campaigns were conducted through phone calls. Multiple contacts to a client were made to determine whether the client subscribed to the bank term deposit or not.

The classification goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to the bank term deposit (yes/no).

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 21 columns, including the output variable 'y'. The objective is to discard the output column and utilize the remaining columns as independent variables (x) to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank deposit.

## Project Approach

1. Data exploration
2. Feature engineering
3. Building training/validation/test samples
4. Model selection
5. Model evaluation
